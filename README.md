# SI 364 - F18 - HW5

### DEADLINE: December 4, 2018 at 11:59 pm

## Overview

You've been provided a bunch of scaffolding code. On top of the provided code, you'll need to add a number of things to make this application work fully, each marked by `TODO 364` inside the `app.py` file.

The things to add in this file are many fewer than your previous assignment -- this assignment is practicing a skill you've already practiced in a class exercise or two, with a new base set of code.

Each `TODO` listed for you is intended to be a small-to-medium size task. In general, you can go through the file top to bottom to address each one, but we've included suggestions in the comments about any time it makes sense to work on a TODO that comes later in the file first.

Your overall objective is to complete building an application to build TODO lists, with individual items on them. You should be able to update individual list *items'* priority values, and you should be able to delete any TODO list that is saved in the app.

Examining the code and instructions will give you further specifics.

Here is a series of screenshots displaying what you should be able to do in the completed application:

* [Example of what you should see after successfully clicking Update on the above screen](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fzzxt8nhfexe3zs/Screenshot%202018-03-26%2001.24.45.png?dl=0)

Note also that the following is the format for entering multiple ToDoList items when creating a list, since it is harder to see in the screenshot:

        Description of item, priorityinteger
        Second item description, priorityinteger

e.g.

        Complete 364 HW5, 2
        Study for capstone exam, 3
        Go to soccer practice, 1

You'll notice that the way this app is built is not exactly an ideal "TODO list" application, of which you can find very many on the internet. There are a lot of unusual things about how the data is managed and how the views show up, in the way you are directed to do this.

That is because the goal of completing these tasks is to practice these important skills -- not to complete a thorough application, this time. If you want to do more work on this that is more advanced, that is completely fine. But the requirements of the app that you should turn in are as stated. They are relatively simple *compared to* a lot of the complex applications you probably engage with and use in real life.

You will be:

* Completing a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application, specifically focusing on the Update and Delete actions
* Continuing to plan around database relationships, forms, view functions, helper functions, and integrating back-end code with templates


## Specific Instructions

* Fork and clone the repository
* Check out the **to submit** instructions so you know how to begin work on this!
* Check out `app.py`, scan through it, read the comments, and complete the `TODO 364` todo items one by one.
* Try to understand all the code. What does this application do? What is missing from it? What is already there? What does this code do? Doing this will be enormously helpful to finishing this assignment more easily.
* Identify anything in the `TODO 364` comments you are confused about so you can ask questions ASAP.
* Consider what example(s) are similar to the tasks at hand -- if you look at the right examples and make analogies to them, this will be much easier to do!
* Make sure to debug along the way!
* Edit the files to ensure you have completed each `TODO 364` item. Each is worth points, and **the total of all `TODO 364` items completed are worth 850 points.**
* Ensure you have everything committed properly and pushed to your new GitHub repo to submit the link properly to Canvas.
* Make some additional change(s) to your application -- ANYTHING that is a change to at least one file.

## To submit (read ALL the below before beginning)

Push *all* of the code files, including any additional files you add and all included files, to this GitHub repository.

Submit the link to your GitHub repository on the Canvas assignment for HW5. It should take the form of: `https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/HW5_364`
